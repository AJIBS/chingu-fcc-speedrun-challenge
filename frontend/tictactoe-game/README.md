# Build a Tic Tac Toe Game

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/KzXQgy/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.

* User Story: My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.

* User Story: I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

## Result

You can view the live version of my Tic Tac Toe game on: https://codepen.io/ajibs/full/wJEbOq/

## Notes

This game was built with Vanilla JS, I did not use any jquery. Improvements would involve:

* Build a game that is aesthetically/functionally similar to https://gsuxlzt.github.io/tictactoe/

* Implement the Minimax Algorithm
